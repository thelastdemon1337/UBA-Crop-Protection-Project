# UBA-Crop-Protection-Project

### Wild boars are one of the major problems for farmers whose land is nearby to the forest. To stop the wild boars entering into the farm, we developed an IoT device that can detect the wild Boars and give loud alert sounds to scare the wild Boars along with iridium lights glowing partially. The main theme of this project is to save the crop from wild animals without harming them.

## I learned dealing with Arduino , Raspberry pi, cron jobs, creating unix Systemctl services , mqtt for data sharing, etc through this project.
